    I'm good listener to the suggestion and new ideas, I have ability to solve the problems in code
    The previous strength keys can be used in the project by listening to all team members and explaining all the points and details of the project and trying to divide the work among the team members so that the work is equal
    We want to develop our own skills so that they have the ability to work collectively and explain all aspects of the project in an easy and simple way to facilitate the implementation process
